# Ascension: Preamble
**Ascension: Preamble** (sometimes denoted as `asc-pre`, `asc-preamble` or simply 'Preamble') is the first game that I plan to make
with the 'Ascension' title.

## Technologies/Dependencies
**Ascension: Preamble** uses the following:
* **WWT** - A project I've been working on to provide a full JS API for widgets. Currently the source is unavailable
* **Journey** - A simple helper to layout and control a single web page for a browser game.
* **Asc** - The engine

Ascension: Preamble runs on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).
